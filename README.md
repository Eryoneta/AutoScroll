# AutoScroll
 A *Google Chrome* extension that improves the default autoscroll.
 
 Many times, when reading a particularly big text, the default autoscroll can be a tricky to adjust, easily picking up high speeds. This extension limits the speed and allow precise control over the autoscroll.

## Usage
- It works normally with `Middle-click`, adjusted to limit itself to a maximum speed.
  - Pressing `Ctrl-Shift-A` also works.
  - You can pause and resume the autoscroll by `Right-click`.
- Another function is to scroll with precision:
  - By pressing any `Arrow`, you can increment the autoscroll speed.
    - `Ctrl-Arrow` allow bigger speed increments.
    - `Enter` doubles the current speed.
  - You can also use the `Right-press` & `ScrollWheel` to increment the vertical speeds.
    - `Left-press` & `ScrollWheel` allow bigger speed increments.
- Horizontal scrolling can be achieved by `Right-press` & `ScrollWheel`, while not autoscrolling.
- If you desire, you can still use the default one by `Right-press` & `Middle-click`.
